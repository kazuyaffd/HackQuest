# OSINT Challenge – Find the Church

## Challenge
When I was overseas I visited a nice church, but I can’t remember what it was called.  
To make it worse, the only picture I have is this photo I took nearby.  
Can you find the name of the nearest church to this location?  

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Clues in the photo:**
   - One car clearly shows branding for **Greenwheels**, an electric car share company based in the **Netherlands**.  
   - The building has signage with **“Oyas”** on the windows.

2. **Pivot on keywords:**
   - Searching **“Oyas Netherlands”** leads to **Oya’s childcare**.

3. **Verify the exact location:**
   - Oya’s Childcare has very few locations in the Netherlands.
   - Using Google Maps / Street View, you can match the **building facade** and confirm the area.

4. **Identify the nearby church:**
   - Just out of frame from this location is the **Obrechtkerk**.

## What You Learned
- Small details (logos, brand names) can reveal a **country or company**.  
- Building signage provides unique keywords for search engines.  
- Geolocation challenges often require **cross-referencing landmarks** and checking what’s nearby.  
- Verifying surroundings in **Google Maps / Street View** helps pinpoint exact answers.
