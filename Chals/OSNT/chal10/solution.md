# 🚋 OSINT Challenge — The Numbered Tram

## Challenge
A friend sent me this photo of a **red tram numbered 49** running through a major European city.  
I need to know the **river that runs through this city**.  


## Solution
1. Searching for *Tram 49 red tram Europe* immediately leads to **Budapest, Hungary**, where tram line 49 is iconic.  
2. The tram crosses the **Liberty Bridge**, one of Budapest’s landmarks.  
3. Budapest is famously split into **Buda** and **Pest** by the **Danube River**.
