# 🐍 Challenge 7 – Math Puzzle

##  How to Solve
1. Open the script. It asks: `factorial(6) + 42`
2. Use Python to compute:
```python
    import math
    print(math.factorial(6) + 42)
```
3. Output: `762`
4. Apply flag format: `CTF{result_is_762}`

## Flag
```c
CTF{result_is_762}
```

## 🎓 What You Learned
- Python’s math library has useful functions like factorial().
- You can use Python itself to solve puzzles.
- Flags can be derived from computed results.
